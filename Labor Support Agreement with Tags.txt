Understanding the role of your labor support doula
	•	A Sokana Collective doula is here to provide non-medical support. They provide education, comfort measures, emotional support and help the client find their voice to advocate for themselves.
	•	They are not doing any clinical/medical tasks such as diagnosing, are not checking fetal tones, blood pressures, vaginal exams etc.
	•	My doula will help me and my partner obtain the information necessary to make informed decisions and will not make decisions for me.
	•	My doula will listen to me and my partners concerns me and suggest options
CANCELLATION OF SERVICES
I understand that if I cancel services more than 4 weeks before my due date, Sokana Collective will retain 30% of my contract rate. I may use the remainder of the balance for any additional services listed above or Sokana Collective can refund the balance. I understand that canceling services less than 4 weeks before my due date will result in no refunds but may still be transferred to an additional service.
REFUND POLICY
I understand that if I have contacted my doula team to request support and no one was able to provide support during labor or birth because they were unavailable, the fees paid for labor support services will be refunded. I understand that no refund will be made if my plans regarding labor support change because:
	•	I failed to call/connect with my doula (primary or backup and admin if necessary) when I was in labor, or did not request their support.
	•	I delayed contacting them and they were not able to support me in time.
	•	I changed my birth plan and I decided to cancel services within 4 weeks of my due date.
	•	I have an unplanned cesarean called during labor.
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO NOTIFY SOKANA COLLECTIVE
Due to the occasional failure of communications technologies, it is your responsibility to make a thorough effort to contact your doula/backup doula/s. Texting alone is not always sufficient. The earliest possible notice will give them the best chance to accommodate your request for support.
If you cannot reach your doula(s) then promptly contact Sokana Collective directly 847-701-5527
