# Draft response to client – doulas, assignments, spreadsheet, contracts

Use or adapt this when replying to your client.

**Hi [Client name],**

Thanks for offering to work on this. Here’s what I need and what I suggest:

---

### 1. Doulas

**Yes – name and email for each doula is enough to start.**  
I’ll use that to set up doula accounts in the system so they can log in and be listed. If you have phone or other contact info, we can add that later, but name + email is the minimum.

---

### 2. Doula-to-client assignments

**What I need:** For each assignment, I need to know **which doula** is (or was) assigned to **which client**.

- **Doulas:** Name and email (so I can match to the doula accounts we create).
- **Clients:** Either:
  - **Client name + email**, or  
  - **Client name + any ID you use** (e.g. from your spreadsheet) so we can match them to the clients already in the system.

A simple format works: e.g. a list or table with columns like **Doula name**, **Doula email**, **Client name**, **Client email** (or client ID), and **Status** if you track it (e.g. active, past, completed). I can then map these into the system.

### 3. Your spreadsheet (color-coded status, all clients since 2021)

**We won’t lose that data.** Here’s what I suggest:

1. **Keep your spreadsheet as the master backup.**  
   Don’t delete or overwrite it. If possible, save a copy (e.g. “Backup as of [date]”) so you always have the full history.

2. **Export a copy for me.**  
   Export the full sheet (all clients since 2021) as **Excel or CSV** so I have the same data. Include:
   - All columns you use (client name, email, status, dates, etc.).
   - A short note or separate column explaining what each **color** means (e.g. “green = active”, “yellow = pending”, “red = completed”). That way we can mirror your status logic in the system.

3. **Next step on our side.**  
   We can then either:
   - Import or migrate that data into the app’s database (so status and history live in the system), or  
   - Use it as a reference to backfill status and assignments without changing your spreadsheet.

So: **no need to get rid of the spreadsheet** – we’ll use it as the source of truth and make sure the system reflects it (and your color coding) rather than replacing it in a way that loses anything.

### 4. Contracts in edoula (left sidebar)

**Yes – I still need those.**  
If you can **download/export the contracts from edoula** and send them to me (or upload them to a folder we agree on), I’ll store them in our system so we have our own copies and aren’t dependent on edoula long-term. You don’t need to change how you use the left sidebar in edoula; just getting the files (e.g. PDFs) is enough. If there are a lot, we can do it in batches or prioritize the most recent first.

**Summary**

| What              | What I need from you |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Doulas            | Name + email per doula. |
| Assignments       | Who is assigned to whom: doula (name/email) + client (name/email or ID), plus status if you have it. |
| Spreadsheet       | Don’t delete it; export a full copy (Excel/CSV) and a note on what each color means so we can preserve that in the system. |
| Contracts (edoula)| Download/export from edoula and send/upload to me so we can store them in our system. |

Thanks again – once I have these, I can wire everything into the app and we’ll keep your history and status logic intact.
